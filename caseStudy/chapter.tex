Describe the case study which will be used throughout the thesis to demonstrate old methods vs new methods.

\section{Energy Efficient Corridor Lighting}
Lighting left on in our schools, universities and offices wastes not only millions of pounds a year but increases our carbon footprint, with an average\footnotemark office lit overnight consuming that equal to the energy needed to boil over a 1,000 cups of tea\cite{cambridgeEnergyWaste,carbonTrustEnergyWaste}. 

To tackle this, the use of smart / intelligent lighting can decrease the amount of energy wasted during off peak times, such as evenings and weekends, when few people are around. Similarly, we can also decrease wastage during summer periods, for offices in which bright sunlight is available. Socially, using automatic lighting prevents issues regarding lighting control over large office spaces, in which there may only be a single main control, where social pressure may prevent a single person from turning off uneeded lights over a shared-space.

Deploying and testing a scheme such as this is a costly and risky challenge, with budget concerns, safety regulations and any on-peak downtime or faults can be costly to businesses or public buildings. On top of this many different technical concerns which would need to be addressed, including, where to place sensors, algorithm robustness/performance, lighting comfort, to name a few. Thus, thorough testing is absolutely required, but, testing in the real-world is limited by the aformentioned concerns.

\subsection{Environment}
\label{subsec:Environment}
This case study focuses on a typical closed-plan office space, with an array of rooms connected by several corridors. Lights are evenly distributed along corridors and within rooms. 

Test scenarios focus on the period of off-peak office usage in which minimal lighting is used, to reduce energy usage. Lighting can be assumed to be using dimmable LED lighting in which the colour and intensity can be adjusted instantaneously, unlike traditional flourescent tubes which can't be dimmed and typically have a 2-3 second delay before turning on (usually flickering).

For sensing office users we could utilise several different sensing technologies, at various abstracts.

  \item Person detection
  \item Motion/PIR Sensors

\section{Fire Evacuation using Distributed Navigation}
Fire evacuation design and planning is a key part of all public buildings, including schools, offices and hospitals, in which ensuring there is a prescribed fire evacuation plan in place, with safe and clearly marked routes to urgently egress a building in the event of a fire or other emergency. 

As part of building regulations \cite{fireLegislation}, architects and building managers must ensure there are adequate escape routes proportional to the size and capacity of a building. Escape routes must be clearly sign posted around the building, providing directions to the closest exit to a given point. These signs are typically printed or illuminated signs, providing only a single fixed direction towards an exit.

However, there are a variety of issues with the current signage approach. In the event of an emergency research has shown people often ignore emergency exit signs and instead attempt to egress via the point they ingress the building. This can often not be the fastest route, both due to distance and the additional congestion on this route caused by many people acting similarly. In the case of a fire en-route to the nearest signposted exit, it may not be possible to determine the safest route to without additional knowledge.

This case study focuses on demonstrating a CPS-enhanced improvement to these signs.


This case study focuses on the concept of a deploying a CPS to aide in navigating a safe evacuation route during a fire alert. The CPS will take a distributed approach to determining a safe route, without the use of global maps or centralised decision nodes. Instead nodes will rely on only local layout knowledge and must determine safe routes through dissemination of locally safe paths.

\subsection{Layout}
Nodes will be placed along corridors, doorways and/or rooms equipped with fire detectors (smoke, heat, etc). Nodes will also be equipped with directional indicators to designate safe routes to an exit. Nodes can be of two types, a pathway node, or exit node. Exit nodes are placed adjacent to fire escape routes, such as stairwells, or exiting doors.

\subsection{Invariants}
\begin{itemize}
  \item No node should direct towards fire.
  \item No two adjacent nodes should point towards one another.
  \item Exits near fire should be avoided.
\end{itemize}

  wait_on_event();

    status = ON_FIRE;
    broadcast(FIRE_ALERT);
  } else if (ev == FIRE_ALERT) {
      blacklist_dir(msg.src);
      status = FIRE_ALERT;
      broadcast(FIRE_ALERT);
      if (self.type == EXIT) {
        broadcast(SAFE_ROUTE);
      }
  } else if (ev == SAFE_ROUTE) {
      whitelist_dir(msg.src);
      broadcast(SAFE_ROUTE);
  }
