@article{GEM,
  abstract = "Event-based monitoring is critical for managing and debugging networks and distributed systems. This paper presents GEM - an interpreted generalized event monitoring language. It allows high-level, abstract events to be specified in terms of combinations of lower-level events from different nodes in a loosely coupled distributed system. Event monitoring components can thus be distributed within the system to perform filtering, correlation and notification of events close to where they occur and thus reduce network traffic. GEM is a declarative rule-based language in which the notion of real time has been closely integrated and various temporal constraints can be specified for event composition. The paper discusses the effect of communication delays on composite event detection and presents a tree-based solution for dealing with out-of-order event arrivals at event monitors.",

These models are non-intuitive to programmers due to the introduction of unnecessary, non-intrinsic complexity. Component-based languages like Insense can eliminate much of this unnecessary complexity via the use of active components and synchronous channels. However, simply layering an Insense implementation over an existing event-based system, like TinyOS, while proving efficacy, is insufficiently space and time efficient for production use. The design and implementation of a new language-specific OS, InceOS, enables both space and time efficient programming of sensor networks using component-based languages like Insense.}

Ard{\'a}n features 3D device (sensor and actuator) placement, flexible time-control, phenomena-on-demand as well visualisation, virtual devices and native application code. The flexibility, control and scalability of Ard{\'a}n is demonstrated with a corridor case-study that supports upto 200 nodes running at real-time or faster.",
