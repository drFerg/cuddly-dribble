abstract = {A large number of low-power wireless communication protocols has been proposed in the last decade by both academia and industry in an attempt to deliver information in an increasingly reliable, timely, and energy-efficient manner. However, their level of dependability has rarely been bench-marked under the same settings and environmental condi-tions. In this paper we present the execution and results of a competition aimed to evaluate the dependability of state-of-the-art low-power wireless protocols under the same set-tings, and push their performance to the limit. We define a scenario emulating the operation of a wireless sensor net-work in industrial environments rich with radio interference and compare the end-to-end dependability of systems based on protocol strategies ranging from adaptive and time-slotted frequency-hopping to multi-modal routing and flooding. To increase fairness and realism, we allow the developers of the competing protocols to interact with the benchmarking infrastructure and optimize the protocol parameters for the scenario at hand. We achieve this by designing, implement-ing, and employing D-Cube, a low-cost tool that allows to accurately measure key dependability metrics such as end-to-end delay, reliability, and power consumption, as well as to graphically visualize their evolution in real-time. This in-teraction with the benchmarking infrastructure and the com-petitiveness of the event have incited the developers to push the performance of their protocols to the limit and reach im-pressive results.},

abstract = {Structural monitoring of critical bridge structures can greatly benefit from the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), however energy harvesting for the operation of the network remains a challenge in this setting. While solar and wind power are possible and credible solutions to energy gen-eration, the need for positioning sensor nodes in shaded and sheltered locations, e.g., under a bridge deck, is also often precluding their adoption in real-world deployments. In some scenarios vibration energy harvesting has been shown as an effective solution, instead. This paper presents a multihop vibration energy-harvesting WSN system for bridge applications. The system relies on an ultra-low power wireless sensor node, driven by a novel vibration based energy-harvesting technology. We use a receiver-initiated routing protocol to enable energy-efficient and reliable connectivity between nodes with different energy charging capabilities. By combining real vibration data with an experimentally validated model of the vibration energy harvester, a hardware model, and the COOJA simulator, we develop a framework to conduct realistic and repeatable ex-periments to evaluate the system before on-site deployment. Simulation results show that the system is able to maintain energy neutral operation, preserving energy with careful man-agement of sleep and communication times. We also validate the system through a laboratory experiment on real hardware against real vibration data collected from a bridge. Besides providing general guidelines and considerations for the de-velopment of vibration energy-harvesting systems for bridge applications, this work highlights the limitations of the energy budget made available by traffic-induced vibrations, which clearly shrink the applicability of vibration energy-harvesting technology for WSNs to low traffic applications.},

@misc{eventDriven,
abstract = {Towards the end of last year I attended a workshop with my colleagues in ThoughtWorks to discuss the nature of “event-driven” applications. Over the last few years we've been building lots of systems that make a lot of use of events, and they've been often praised, and often damned. Our North American office organized a summit, and ThoughtWorks senior developers from all over the world showed up to share ideas. The biggest outcome of the summit was recognizing that when people talk about “events”, they actually mean some quite different things. So we spent a lot of time trying to tease out what some useful patterns might be. This note is a brief summary of the main ones we identified.},

The intention is to avoid what the 9/11 Commission calls the 'failure of imagination' that left society vulnerable to attack in 2001. The scenario that we generate is fictional. However, the response is informed by the emergency plans published by several NHS trusts, by direct involvement in evacuation drills and also by ways in which staff have responded to previous non-terrorist incidents.

@article{Helbing,
abstract = {Starting with a short review of the available literature in the field of pedestrian and evacuation research, an overview is given over the ob-served collective phenomena in pedestrian crowds. This includes lane for-mation in corridors and oscillations at bottlenecks in normal situations, while different kinds of blocked states are produced in panic situations. By means of molecular-dynamic-like microsimulations based on a general-ized force model of interactive pedestrian dynamics, the spatio-temporal patterns in pedestrian crowds are successfully reproduced and interpreted as self-organized phenomena. In contrast to previous socio-psychological approaches, this allows a physical understanding of the observations. De-spite the significantly different phenomena occuring in normal and panic situations, the main effects can be described by a unified model containing only well interpretable and plausible terms. The transition between the " ra-tional " normal behavior and the apparently " irrational " panic behavior is controlled by a single parameter, the " nervousness " , which influences fluc-tuation strengths, desired speeds, and the tendency of herding. Thereby, it causes paradoxial effects like " freezing by heating " , " faster is slower " , and the ignorance of available exits. Nevertheless, there are measures to improve pedestrian flows, both in normal and panic situations. For exam-ple, the suitable placement of columns can help, although they reduce the accessible space.},

However there are times when we don't just want to see where we are, we also want to know how we got there.

Not just can we query these events, we can also use the event log to reconstruct past states, and as a foundation to automatically adjust the state to cope with retroactive changes.},

The following pages describe how one group of evacuation simulations has been extended to support the risk assessments that drive counter terrorism. Two key areas are discussed; changes in the human response to the detonation of improvised explosive devices and the modelling of coordinated attack scenarios. These two issues create significant differences between the use of simulators to model ‘conventional ' evacuations and those that can be used to mitigate the effects of terrorist attacks.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) realise sensing and actu-ating infrastructures available for diverse applications with disparate requirements. These systems intertwine with the surrounding environment, making system performance dif-ficult to foresee. During and after deployment, the ability to operate and validate the infrastructure is hampered by the limited visibility and the costs of testing alternative config-urations. We propose MorjeuV, a framework able to ana-lyse the performance of the target application in a faithful simulation. By calibrating the models with real measure-ments, MorjeuV can compute a virtual copy of the target system and reason about it. In particular, the visibility over the system state allows a thorough analysis of performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, the impact of alternative reconfig-uration strategies can be tested beforehand. We instantiate our ideas in a prototype, with which we show that MorjeuV can suggest which nodes to activate in a physical infrastruc-ture to control the application performance.},

@article{Sime1983,
abstract = {Two models of escape behaviour are contrasted in an analysis of flight from a fire by 128 people in a public building. The ‘panic' model assumes that escape involves a homogeneous population of individuals concerned with self-preservation, competing with each other for limited exits. The ‘affiliative' model2 predicts individuals with close psychological ties will attempt to escape in groups of two or more; flight is assumed to involve escape to familiar persons and places. Causal loglinear analysis was used to model the inter-relationships between four variables in a 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 cross-classified categorical table: (A) Group Membership (family/mixed); (B) Group Attachment at Cue (attached/separated); (C) Cue (ambiguous/verbal/unambiguous); (D) Group Affiliation at Exit (affiliated/separated). Associations were found between [BC] and [ABD] indicating strong support for model. In a situation of potential danger ‘separated' individuals responded more often to ‘ambiguous' cues. ‘Family' members who were attached at cue were most likely to be together and ‘mixed' group members apart when exiting from the building. Family members tried to adopt an optimal strategy for group rather than individual survival.},
